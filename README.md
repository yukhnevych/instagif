# Instagif

### To run the project follow these steps:

1. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to open devserver and view the app

I've used create-react-app to bootstrap application and quickly setup dev environment.

### Technologies used
- `React` - to be able to render all UI
- `Redux` - to store application state
    - `redux-promise-middleware` - used to simplify async actions in `Redux`
- `Bulma` - to quickly style the application
